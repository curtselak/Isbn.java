The copy of RangeMessage.xml in this folder is one that I've made for 
generating the Isbn.java source file. All that is necessary is to run 
Isbn.xsl, which is in the xslt directory, against it. I've taken care 
of the rest (i.e., checked for names that can't serve as legal Java 
language identifiers, and run the other .xsl files in the xslt folder).

The release may be based on a copy of RangeMessage.xml that is older than 
the one in this folder. Releases are pro forma: I make them just to test 
them regularly and to thereby make certain that nothing has broken, as 
could happen were the structure of RangeMessage.xml to change.

To generate the javadoc (you might want to compile Isbn.java just to do this, 
if you find the javadoc easier to read than the pdf available from the 
International ISBN Agency's website), use a command like the following:

javadoc -author -protected -d ../Isbn/docs -link 
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api 
io.sourceforge.curtthomas.isbn

where ../Isbn/docs stands for where you choose to 
keep the command's output.
